                The numbering of elements requires no manual intervention. If you need to force a specific number, add a

        <p id="p2">
            The late 1870s, in Staffordshire as in England generally, marked the beginning of a long period during which
    agriculture was exposed to the full force of foreign competition and was often held by contemporaries to be in
    depression.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn1" id="fnr1" title="For general accounts see E. H. Whetham, Agrarian Hist. vi (1), 216&ndash;357; P. J. Perry, Brit. Agric. 1875&ndash;1914,
        1&ndash;40.
    "> (fn. 1)</a>
    The period was one of low or falling rents and prices and of declining employment. Farmers were compelled to reduce
    costs and to alter their methods to produce those goods whose prices were least affected by imports. Those
    constraints persisted until the outbreak of the Second World War, though the First World War gave a brief respite.

        </p>
        
        <p id="p3">
            The beginning of the period of adjustment is difficult to pinpoint: on some estates rents were falling from 1870, on
    others they declined only from the late 1870s.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn2" id="fnr2" title="Below (rents)."> (fn. 2)</a>
    The weather in the 1870s was frequently unfavourable. In 1877 floods of the Trent at Trentham were said to have
    destroyed the hay crop six times since 1865.

        <h3 id="h3-s2">Arable Farming</h3>
        
        <p id="p4">
            From the mid 1870s until 1939 the importance of arable farming in Staffordshire declined, apart from a brief recovery
    as a result of government action during the First World War. Arable acreage fell from 226,566 a. in 1875 to 150,554
    a. in 1915, rose to 185,432 a. in 1918 (far less than the government's requirement), and fell again to 114,184 a. in
    1938.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn6" id="fnr6" title="Agric. Returns G.B."> (fn. 6)</a>
    In 1915 only the Lichfield and Brownhills, the Wolverhampton, and the Kingswinford and Wordsley petty sessional
    districts had more than half their land under the plough; while the Cheadle, Uttoxeter, and Leek districts, covering
    the Moorlands, had less than 10 per cent arable.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn7" id="fnr7" title="Rep. on Agric. and Ind. Conditions in Staffs. for 1915, 12&ndash;13."> (fn. 7)</a>

        </p>
        
        <p class="page-break">[Page 2]</p>
        
        <p id="p5">
            There were, however, some changes in the balance of cropping. Wheat acreage declined from 60,092 a. in 1868 to 25,532
    a. in 1916; it rose again under the government's ploughing-up campaign to 37,378 a. in 1919 but fell to 13,559 a. in
    1931. As a result of the guaranteed minimum price under the Wheat Act, 1932,
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn8" id="fnr8" title="22 &amp; 23 Geo. V, c. 12."> (fn. 8)</a>
    the acreage increased again to 26,022 in 1939.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn9" id="fnr9" title="Agric. Returns G.B."> (fn. 9)</a>
    It was then more or less evenly distributed, but was absent in the north-east and on Cannock Chase and was most
    important on the light soils of the south.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn10" id="fnr10" title="Types of Farming Map of Eng. &amp; Wales (Min. of Agric. 1941), sheet 8."> (fn. 10)</a>

        </p>
        
        <p id="p6">
            Barley declined more markedly from 32,660 a. in 1870 to 1,698 a. in 1939; it became concentrated almost exclusively
    on the light soils.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn11" id="fnr11" title="Agric. Returns G.B.; Types of Farming Map, sheet 8."> (fn. 11)</a>
    The area under oats, which were grown more easily than barley on heavy and moorland soils, fluctuated; it increased
    at the expense of barley to 37,522 a. in 1900, declined to 34,686 a. in 1916, reached a peak of 51,000 a. in 1918,
    and then fell again to 21,255 a. in 1939.

        <p id="p7">The conversion of arable to permanent grass continued fairly steadily from 1875 to 1939, except during the brief
    reversion to arable caused by the First World War. By 1939 permanent grass occupied 78 per cent of the total crops
    and grass. The grass acreage, however, reached its peak in 1910, and it grew most rapidly before 1890.</p>
        
        <h4 id="h4-s1">Cattle and Dairying</h4>
        
        <p id="p8">
            The number of cattle increased from 138,940 in 1875 to 300,803 in 1973. The only significant set-back was a fall from
    189,276 animals in 1919 to 166,367 in 1920. The increase is largely attributable to the continued expansion of
    dairying.

        </p>
        
        <p class="page-break">[Page 3]</p>
        
        <p id="p9">
            The intensification of dairying was accompanied by a change of emphasis from cheese production to liquid-milk sales.
    The change was precipitated by large-scale imports of American cheese in 1879, which reduced cheese prices
    disastrously. In north Staffordshire some farmers gave up dairying altogether. By 1881 cheese-making had been
    'nearly done away with' round Lichfield, where labour difficulties aggravated the price fall; farmers were 'nearly
    all sending their milk away as milk'.

        </p>
        
        <p id="p10">
            By 1890 milk was 'the chief article on which the farmer depends' in the Rocester area,
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn14" id="fnr14" title="V.C.H. Staffs. ii. 210."> (fn. 14)</a>
    and cheese-making was rare round Burton-upon-Trent by 1888.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn15" id="fnr15" title="Ibid. 211."> (fn. 15)</a>
    Most of the milk was sent by rail to London.

        <h4 id="h4-s2">Sheep</h4>
        
        <p id="p11">
            Sheep-farming has become less significant in the 20th century than in the 19th. Between the 1870s and the First World
    War the number of sheep in the county tended to fall. After the war, as F. R. Twemlow put it in 1919, 'sheep have
    been given up as a bad job. They cannot be used at home, nor can they be sold at market for a fair price, under the
    present system of control.'
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn18" id="fnr18" title="S.R.O., D. 3643/F/11/24, F. R. Twemlow to Min. of Agric. 22 Jan. 1919."> (fn. 18)</a>
    There were 212,016 in 1915 but only 108,616 in 1923.

        </p>
        
        <p id="p12">
            The breeds of sheep kept also changed, perhaps because of a shift from fattening or folding sheep on arable to
    keeping them less intensively on grassland.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn19" id="fnr19" title="Above (grassland)."> (fn. 19)</a>
    In the late 19th century the Shropshire sheep remained predominant, especially in the southern arable areas, as its
    early maturity suited it to the fat-lamb trade.

        <h3 id="h3-s4">Agrarian Economy and Society</h3>
        
        <p id="p13">In the late 19th century some of the great estates of Staffordshire were still growing. Lord Harrowby, for example,
    bought 418 a. in 1890 and a further 116 a. in 1891; the Sandon estate, which had been 4,100 a. in 1856, covered
    6,170 a. in the late 1890s.</p>
        
        <p class="page-break">[Page 4]</p>
        
        <h4 id="h4-s3">Estate Sales and Owner-Occupation</h4>
        
        <p id="p14">
            In the early years of the 20th century the great estates began to break up. Lord Ferrers sold the Chartley estate in
    1904; nearly half went to one purchaser, much of the rest to sitting tenants.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn21" id="fnr21" title="S.R.O., D. 240/E/20/1&ndash;9."> (fn. 21)</a>
    Lord Macclesfield sold his Croxden estate and other lands in north Staffordshire in 1913, some of it to the tenants,
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn22" id="fnr22" title="Ibid. D. 3288/2/12/1&ndash;6."> (fn. 22)</a>
    and in 1914 the duke of Sutherland sold most of his property at Tittensor in Stone and Great Wyrley in Cannock.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn23" id="fnr23" title="Ibid. D. 593/A/1/1/76&ndash;7; D. 593/A/2/4/50."> (fn. 23)</a>

        </p>
        
        <p id="p15">
            Between 1918 and 1921 much more land was thrown on the market, though sales were perhaps less extensive in
    Staffordshire than elsewhere.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn24" id="fnr24" title="Below (prices)."> (fn. 24)</a>
    The estates were generally sold in lots and many farms were bought by their tenants. In 1918 2,938 a. of the
    Giffards' Chillington estate, Lord Anglesey's 5,091-a. Burton estate, 880 a. of Lord Stafford's land round Stafford,
    much of Lord Shrewsbury's property including 6,475 a. at Alton, the Sneyd-Kinnersleys' estate of 2,394 a. at Loxley
    Park, and the Staffordshire estates of the earl of Wilton and Baroness Zouche were advertised for sale.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn25" id="fnr25" title="Staffs. Advertiser, 27 July, 3 Aug., 31 Aug., 21 Sept., 28 Sept., 12 Oct. 1918."> (fn. 25)</a>

        </p>
        
        <h4 id="h4-s4">Agricultural Rents</h4>
        
        <p id="p16">The reduction of agricultural rents in Staffordshire in the late 19th century was less than in many other parts of
    England, partly because the county was already predominantly pastoral. Rents fell further in south than in north
    Staffordshire, and further on arable farms than on grass ones. Serious difficulties for both landlords and tenants
    generally began in the late 1870s.</p>
        
        <p id="p17">
            The rental value of farm-land at Trentham began falling in 1877; it was than 42s. 11d. an acre, but by 1881 was down
    to 38s. 11d. In 1879 there were rent reductions averaging 13&frac12; per cent on six farms, but three of the reductions
    were temporary.

        <h4 id="h4-s5">Farm Labour and Wages</h4>
        
        <p id="p18">
            The numbers occupied in agriculture greatly declined. In 1871 there were 31,029, in 1921 24,820, and in 1973 12,131.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn27" id="fnr27" title="Census, 1871&ndash;1971; Agric. Returns G.B. 1973."> (fn. 27)</a>
    The proportion of labourers to farmers also declined, especially in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1871
    the workforce included 11,038 farmers and their families, 14,127 out-labourers, and 4,997 farm servants;
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn28" id="fnr28" title="Census, 1871."> (fn. 28)</a>
    by 1911 there were still 10,264 farmers and their working relatives but only 12,460 farm servants and labourers.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn29" id="fnr29" title="Census, 1911."> (fn. 29)</a>

        </p>
        
        <p id="p19">
            In 1879 a labourer estimated that agricultural wages were only some 12s.&ndash;15s. a week, though farmers complained that
    such rates were ruinous.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn30" id="fnr30" title="Rep. of R.C. on Agric. Depression, p. 439."> (fn. 30)</a>
    By 1881 15s. or 16s. was a common wage for ordinary labourers, though one witness to the Royal Commission on
    Agriculture paid 18s. or more; up to 21s. was paid to stockmen and other skilled workers. Those rates often included
    a rent-free cottage; when rent was charged it was generally &pound;4&ndash;&pound;4 10s. a year.

        </p>
        
        <p id="p20">
            During the First World War weekly wage rates, which from 1917 were subject to a minimum imposed under the Corn
    Production Act,
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn31" id="fnr31" title="7 &amp; 8 Geo. V, c. 46."> (fn. 31)</a>
    rose rapidly. By July 1917 the wage averaged 24s. By May 1918 the wages of ordinary labourers varied from 26s. to
    27s., and those of wagoners and stockmen could be up to 30s. In that year the Agricultural Wages Board raised the
    minimum to 35s.

        <h3 id="h3-s5">Agricultural Education</h3>
        
        <p id="p21">
            The 1890s saw great advances in the provision of agricultural education. In 1891 Lord Hatherton established an
    agricultural technical school at Penkridge for the children of labourers on his estate and organized a series of
    dairy lectures and demonstrations on his farms.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn33" id="fnr33" title="Staffs. Educ. Ctee. Tech. Instruction Sub-Ctee. Rep. 1891, 6."> (fn. 33)</a>
    More important for the future was the work of the county council's technical instruction committee, set up in 1890
    under the Technical Instruction Act, 1889.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn34" id="fnr34" title="52 &amp; 53 Vic. c. 76."> (fn. 34)</a>

        </p>
        
        <p class="page-break">[Page 6]</p>
        
        <p id="p22">In 1891 the committee engaged two peripatetic instructors to give lectures on agriculture at villages throughout the
    county. In the winter of 1891&ndash;2 general lectures on agriculture were given at 23 villages, and short courses on
    dairy work at ten. Butter- and cheese-making demonstrations were arranged. By 1895 there were separate courses in
    the making of Cheshire and Staffordshire cheese, and by 1898 there was a travelling dairy school.</p>
        
        <p id="p23">
            In 1898 an agricultural side was opened at Brewood grammar school, providing a three-year course of theoretical and
    practical instruction in agriculture and related subjects. The technical instruction committee provided a building
    grant and three (by 1913 five) agricultural scholarships.
    <a class="footnote" href="#fnn35" id="fnr35" title="Staffs. Educ. Ctee. Rep. 1897&ndash;8, 25; 1898&ndash;9, 21; 1912&ndash;13, 55."> (fn. 35)</a>
    In the years before the First World War the teaching of agricultural and horticultural subjects at council schools
    was greatly extended. In 1904 four schools offered gardening courses. By 1913 there were 192, and 8 schools offered
    poultry-keeping and 7 bee-keeping courses.

    but they were postponed until after the First World War. In 1919 the War Agricultural Committee opened its former
    tractor depot at Dunston in Penkridge as a training depot for men working in agriculture; in the same year the
    county council bought Rodbaston Hall (also in Penkridge) and the depot was transferred there. A farm institute was
    finally opened at Rodbaston in 1921.

            It provided 22-week winter courses for youths of 16&ndash;20 who intended to make their living from the land, and 17-week
    summer courses in dairying, poultry-keeping, and domestic science for women over 16. There was a 300-a. farm
    attached, which was run as a commercial venture.

    built. In October 1944 the institute was reopened on pre-war lines with an additional summer course for men.

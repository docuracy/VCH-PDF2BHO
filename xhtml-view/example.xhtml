        <header>Overview</header>
        <p>This sample document demonstrates the simplicity of preparing VCH content in standard XHTML for use in
            BHO.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The numbering of elements requires no manual intervention. If you need to force a specific number, add a
                <code>data-start</code> attribute to the relevant element; the automatic sequence continues from that
                point.
            </li>

            <li>Footnotes should be written inline using <code>&lt;data&gt;</code> elements.</li>

            <li>The unformatted document can be examined in any modern web browser without additional tooling.</li>

            <li>The page title must be entered in the first <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element; subtitles can be added
                using <code>&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;</code>.
            </li>

            <li>The BHO <code>pubid</code> (if known) should be included in a <code>&lt;data-pubid="..."&gt;</code>
                attribute in the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element. It is used to generate urls for BHO images and
                pages.
            </li>

            <li>Formatting uses ordinary, readable XHTML elements:
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;u&gt; <u>underline</u></li>
                    <li>&lt;i&gt; <i>italic</i></li>
                    <li>&lt;b&gt; <b>bold</b></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Page breaks are indicated using <code>&lt;hr class="page-break"&gt;</code>. Page numbers are added
                automatically.
            </li>

            <li>Use of XHTML ensures strict adherence to XML rules, simplifying automated processing and reducing
                parsing errors.
            </li>

            <li>Transformation into the HTML format required by Drupal (including element numbering and extraction of
                <code>&lt;data&gt;</code>
                notes into a separate, hyperlinked <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> block) is handled entirely by an XSLT
                stylesheet. The
                navigation <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> block is also generated automatically.
            </li>

            <li>The document remains editable in any standard text, HTML, or XML editor.</li>

            <li>The same XHTML can be converted into formats such as PDF or Word using standard tools, or ingested by
                other content management systems as needed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        The remainder of this document is a selection of VCH content prepared in XHTML format. It can be viewed in its
        naked simplicity <a

        <header>VCH Content Example - Staffordshire</header>

        <p>The late 1870s, in Staffordshire as in England generally, marked the beginning of a long period during which
            agriculture was exposed to the full force of foreign competition and was often held by contemporaries to be
            in
            depression.
            <data>For general accounts see E. H. Whetham, Agrarian Hist. vi (1), 216–357; P. J. Perry, Brit. Agric.
                1875–1914,
                1–40.
            </data>
            The period was one of low or falling rents and prices and of declining employment. Farmers were compelled to
            reduce
            costs and to alter their methods to produce those goods whose prices were least affected by imports. Those
            constraints persisted until the outbreak of the Second World War, though the First World War gave a brief
            respite.
        </p>

        <p>The beginning of the period of adjustment is difficult to pinpoint: on some estates rents were falling from
            1870, on
            others they declined only from the late 1870s.
            <data>Below (rents).</data>
            The weather in the 1870s was frequently unfavourable. In 1877 floods of the Trent at Trentham were said to
            have
            destroyed the hay crop six times since 1865.

            The wet summer of 1879 was disastrous in many places, though not universally.

            Successive wet years caused widespread losses of stock from liver rot.

            <header>Arable Farming</header>

            <p>From the mid 1870s until 1939 the importance of arable farming in Staffordshire declined, apart from a
                brief recovery
                as a result of government action during the First World War. Arable acreage fell from 226,566 a. in 1875
                to 150,554
                a. in 1915, rose to 185,432 a. in 1918 (far less than the government's requirement), and fell again to
                114,184 a. in
                1938.
                <data>Agric. Returns G.B.</data>
                In 1915 only the Lichfield and Brownhills, the Wolverhampton, and the Kingswinford and Wordsley petty
                sessional
                districts had more than half their land under the plough; while the Cheadle, Uttoxeter, and Leek
                districts, covering
                the Moorlands, had less than 10 per cent arable.

            </p>

            <hr class="page-break"/>

            <p>There were, however, some changes in the balance of cropping. Wheat acreage declined from 60,092 a. in
                1868 to 25,532
                a. in 1916; it rose again under the government's ploughing-up campaign to 37,378 a. in 1919 but fell to
                13,559 a. in
                1931. As a result of the guaranteed minimum price under the Wheat Act, 1932,
                <data>22 &amp; 23 Geo. V, c. 12.</data>
                the acreage increased again to 26,022 in 1939.
                <data>Agric. Returns G.B.</data>
                It was then more or less evenly distributed, but was absent in the north-east and on Cannock Chase and
                was most
                important on the light soils of the south.
                <data>Types of Farming Map of Eng. &amp; Wales (Min. of Agric. 1941), sheet 8.</data>
            </p>

            <p>Barley declined more markedly from 32,660 a. in 1870 to 1,698 a. in 1939; it became concentrated almost
                exclusively
                on the light soils.
                <data>Agric. Returns G.B.; Types of Farming Map, sheet 8.</data>
                The area under oats, which were grown more easily than barley on heavy and moorland soils, fluctuated;
                it increased
                at the expense of barley to 37,522 a. in 1900, declined to 34,686 a. in 1916, reached a peak of 51,000
                a. in 1918,
                and then fell again to 21,255 a. in 1939.

            <header>Grassland and Stock</header>

            <p>The conversion of arable to permanent grass continued fairly steadily from 1875 to 1939, except during
                the
                brief
                reversion to arable caused by the First World War. By 1939 permanent grass occupied 78 per cent of the
                total
                crops
                and grass. The grass acreage, however, reached its peak in 1910, and it grew most rapidly before
                1890.</p>

                <header>Cattle and Dairying</header>

                <p>The number of cattle increased from 138,940 in 1875 to 300,803 in 1973. The only significant set-back
                    was a
                    fall from
                    189,276 animals in 1919 to 166,367 in 1920. The increase is largely attributable to the continued
                    expansion
                    of
                    dairying.
                    <data>Below (dairying).</data>

                <hr class="page-break" data-start="180"/>

                <p>The intensification of dairying was accompanied by a change of emphasis from cheese production to
                    liquid-milk
                    sales.
                    The change was precipitated by large-scale imports of American cheese in 1879, which reduced cheese
                    prices
                    disastrously. In north Staffordshire some farmers gave up dairying altogether. By 1881 cheese-making
                    had
                    been
                    'nearly done away with' round Lichfield, where labour difficulties aggravated the price fall;
                    farmers were
                    'nearly
                    all sending their milk away as milk'.

                <p>By 1890 milk was 'the chief article on which the farmer depends' in the Rocester area,

                <header>Sheep</header>

                <p>Sheep-farming has become less significant in the 20th century than in the 19th. Between the 1870s and
                    the
                    First World
                    War the number of sheep in the county tended to fall. After the war, as F. R. Twemlow put it in
                    1919, 'sheep
                    have
                    been given up as a bad job. They cannot be used at home, nor can they be sold at market for a fair
                    price,
                    under the
                    present system of control.'

                    There were 212,016 in 1915 but only 108,616 in 1923.
                </p>

                <p>The breeds of sheep kept also changed, perhaps because of a shift from fattening or folding sheep on
                    arable
                    to
                    keeping them less intensively on grassland.
                    <data>Above (grassland).</data>
                    In the late 19th century the Shropshire sheep remained predominant, especially in the southern
                    arable areas,
                    as its
                    early maturity suited it to the fat-lamb trade.

                bought 418 a. in 1890 and a further 116 a. in 1891; the Sandon estate, which had been 4,100 a. in 1856,

                    The estates were generally sold in lots and many farms were bought by their tenants. In 1918 2,938

                <header>Agricultural Rents</header>

                <p>The reduction of agricultural rents in Staffordshire in the late 19th century was less than in many
                    other
                    parts of
                    England, partly because the county was already predominantly pastoral. Rents fell further in south
                    than
                    in
                    north
                    Staffordshire, and further on arable farms than on grass ones. Serious difficulties for both
                    landlords
                    and
                    tenants
                    generally began in the late 1870s.</p>

                <p>The rental value of farm-land at Trentham began falling in 1877; it was than 42s. 11d. an acre, but
                    by
                    1881
                    was down
                    to 38s. 11d. In 1879 there were rent reductions averaging 13½ per cent on six farms, but three of
                    the
                    reductions
                    were temporary.

                <header>Farm Labour and Wages</header>

                <p>The numbers occupied in agriculture greatly declined. In 1871 there were 31,029, in 1921 24,820, and
                    in
                    1973
                    12,131.
                    <data>Census, 1871–1971; Agric. Returns G.B. 1973.</data>
                    The proportion of labourers to farmers also declined, especially in the late 19th and early 20th
                    centuries.
                    In 1871
                    the workforce included 11,038 farmers and their families, 14,127 out-labourers, and 4,997 farm
                    servants;
                    <data>Census, 1871.</data>
                    by 1911 there were still 10,264 farmers and their working relatives but only 12,460 farm servants
                    and
                    labourers.
                    <data>Census, 1911.</data>
                </p>

                <p>In 1879 a labourer estimated that agricultural wages were only some 12s.–15s. a week, though farmers
                    complained that
                    such rates were ruinous.
                    <data>Rep. of R.C. on Agric. Depression, p. 439.</data>
                    By 1881 15s. or 16s. was a common wage for ordinary labourers, though one witness to the Royal
                    Commission on
                    Agriculture paid 18s. or more; up to 21s. was paid to stockmen and other skilled workers. Those
                    rates
                    often
                    included
                    a rent-free cottage; when rent was charged it was generally £4–£4 10s. a year.
                </p>

                <p>During the First World War weekly wage rates, which from 1917 were subject to a minimum imposed under
                    the
                    Corn
                    Production Act,
                    <data>7 &amp; 8 Geo. V, c. 46.</data>
                    rose rapidly. By July 1917 the wage averaged 24s. By May 1918 the wages of ordinary labourers varied
                    from
                    26s. to
                    27s., and those of wagoners and stockmen could be up to 30s. In that year the Agricultural Wages
                    Board
                    raised the
                    minimum to 35s.

            <header>Agricultural Education</header>

            <p>The 1890s saw great advances in the provision of agricultural education. In 1891 Lord Hatherton
                established
                an
                agricultural technical school at Penkridge for the children of labourers on his estate and organized a
                series of
                dairy lectures and demonstrations on his farms.
                <data>Staffs. Educ. Ctee. Tech. Instruction Sub-Ctee. Rep. 1891, 6.</data>
                More important for the future was the work of the county council's technical instruction committee, set
                up
                in 1890
                under the Technical Instruction Act, 1889.

            </p>

            <hr class="page-break"/>

            <p>In 1891 the committee engaged two peripatetic instructors to give lectures on agriculture at villages
                throughout the
                county. In the winter of 1891–2 general lectures on agriculture were given at 23 villages, and short
                courses
                on
                dairy work at ten. Butter- and cheese-making demonstrations were arranged. By 1895 there were separate
                courses in
                the making of Cheshire and Staffordshire cheese, and by 1898 there was a travelling dairy school.</p>

            <p>In 1898 an agricultural side was opened at Brewood grammar school, providing a three-year course of
                theoretical and
                practical instruction in agriculture and related subjects. The technical instruction committee provided
                a
                building
                grant and three (by 1913 five) agricultural scholarships.

                In the years before the First World War the teaching of agricultural and horticultural subjects at
                council
                schools
                was greatly extended. In 1904 four schools offered gardening courses. By 1913 there were 192, and 8
                schools
                offered
                poultry-keeping and 7 bee-keeping courses.

            <p>In 1913 there were plans to establish a farm institute near Stafford,
                <data>Staffs. Educ. Ctee. Rep. 1912–13, 42.</data>
                but they were postponed until after the First World War. In 1919 the War Agricultural Committee opened
                its
                former
                tractor depot at Dunston in Penkridge as a training depot for men working in agriculture; in the same
                year
                the
                county council bought Rodbaston Hall (also in Penkridge) and the depot was transferred there. A farm
                institute was
                finally opened at Rodbaston in 1921.

            <p>It provided 22-week winter courses for youths of 16–20 who intended to make their living from the land,
                and
                17-week
                summer courses in dairying, poultry-keeping, and domestic science for women over 16. There was a 300-a.
                farm
                attached, which was run as a commercial venture.

                The institute was requisitioned in 1940; it was later used to train Land Girls on short courses, and a
                hostel was
                built. In October 1944 the institute was reopened on pre-war lines with an additional summer course for
                men.
                <data>Ibid. 1944–5, 28.</data>
                In the 1950s and 1960s the number of students was greatly increased, and the buildings were extended. In
                1967 the
                institute became the Staffordshire College of Agriculture.
